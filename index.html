            <h1><span>About Me</span></h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is <Strong>Anton</Strong>, I am 25 years old. I was born and raised in Minsk, Belarus. When I was in school, I dreamed of becoming a programmer, but after exams I entered the Belarusian National Technical University at the Faculty of Mechanics and Technology. After 5 years of training in a specialty that I donâ€™t like, I worked in a factory in the sales department. After all this, I have not lost interest in computers and decided to find my place in the IT field. For this, I used SoloLearn to learn Python, Ruby, C#, HTML, CSS, and JS. From all this variety, I liked HTML and CSS.
